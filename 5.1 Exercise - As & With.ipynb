Call this `num_trips`\n- The average speed, measured in miles per hour, for trips that started in that hour of the day.  Average speed in miles per hour is calculated as `3600 * SUM(trip_miles) / SUM(trip_seconds)`. Call this column `avg_mph`. The value 3600 is used to convert from seconds to hours.\n\nFor 2017, we're missing August and everything after. So restrict your query to data meeting the following criteria\n- a `trip_start_timestamp` between **2017-01-01** and **2017-07-01**\n- `trip_seconds` > 0 and `trip_miles` > 0\n\n\nYou will use a CTE to select just the relevant rides.
