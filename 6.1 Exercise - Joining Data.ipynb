For example, to select just the third row of the `pets` table, we would write\n\n`SELECT * FROM PETS WHERE NAME LIKE 'Ripley'`\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ef4Puo3.png)\n\nYou can also use `%` as a \"wildcard\" for any number of characters. So you can get the third row with \n\n`SELECT * FROM PETS WHERE NAME LIKE '%ipl%'`\n\nTry this yourself.\nBefore finding users who have answered questions, write a query that selects the `id`, `title` and `owner_user_id` from the `posts_questions` table. Restrict the results to rows that contain the word **bigquery** in the `tags` column. Include rows where there is other text in addition to the word `bigquery` (e.g. if a row has a tag `bigquery-sql`, your results should include that too)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Your code here\nquestions_query = \\\n\"\"\"\nSELECT id, title, owner_user_id\nFROM `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_questions`\nWHERE tags LIKE '%bigquery%'\n\"\"\"\n\nquestions_results = stack_overflow.query_to_pandas_safe(questions_query, max_gb_scanned=25) # this query reads a lot of data\nprint(questions_results.head())\nq_3.check()\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# q_3.hint()\n# q_3.solution()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 4 Your First Join\nNow that you have a query to select questions on any given topic (in this case, you chose `bigquery`), you can find the answers to those questions with a **JOIN**.  \n\nWrite a SQL query that returns the `id`, `body` and `owner_user_id` from the `posts_answers` table for answers to `bigquery` related questions. That is, you should have one row in your results for each answer to a question that has a `bigquery` in the tag.\n\nHere's a reminder of what a **JOIN** looked like in the tutorial\n```\nSELECT p.Name AS Pet_Name, o.Name as Owner_Name\nFROM `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.pets` as p\nINNER JOIN `bigquery-public-data.pet_records.owners` as o ON p.ID = o.Pet_ID\n```\n\nIt may be useful to scroll up and review the results from when you called **head** on `posts_answers` and `posts_questions`.
