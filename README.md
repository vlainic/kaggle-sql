Crash course on SQL by Kaggle

I was applying for the data analyst job in the abnk, locally in Novi Sad. They called me for the technical skill test on English, Excel and SQL. They called me even though I clearly emphasized that I do not know SQL. So I decided to learn something fast, I did Udacity's ["Intro to Relational Databases"](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-relational-databases--ud197) and Kaggle's [Learn SQL](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/sql). Unfortunately I only saved things from the latter one, so I will share my solution here.

Note that I do recommended both courses, but first to the Kaggle one ;)
